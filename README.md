# Synaptix Frontier AI Hack – Round 2 Proposal

This repository contains the proposal submission for Round 2 of the
Synaptix Frontier AI Hack conducted as part of Shaastra 2026 at IIT Madras.

## Track
Track 1 – Agentic AI (Applied GenAI)

## Project Title
Live Bug Report Analyzer & Prioritization Agent for Small Development Teams

## Description
The project proposes an agentic AI system that continuously monitors live bug
reports and their updates, maintains contextual memory for each issue, and
dynamically reassesses bug severity and priority in real time.

The focus of this submission is on system design, agent flow, and the use of
Pathway’s streaming and stateful processing capabilities rather than on
implementation.

## Status
This repository currently contains no implementation code.
The complete system design, architecture, and agent behavior are documented
in the proposal PDF submitted for Round 2.

## Notes
This repository serves as a placeholder to outline the intended project
structure and future development direction.
